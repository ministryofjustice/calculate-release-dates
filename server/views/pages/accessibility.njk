            <p class="govuk-body">This accessibility statement applies to the Court cases and release dates service.
                This website is run by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). We want as many people as possible to be able to
                use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
                <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
                <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
                <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader(including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA
                    and VoiceOver)
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
                <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use
                if you have a disability.</p>

            </p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement procedure</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the
                Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the
                ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a
                    href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the
                    Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">The Ministry of Justice is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance
                with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations
                2018.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">This website is fully compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web
                    Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">The ‘Start now’ button fails to meet the minimum non-text contrast requirements with a
                contrast ratio of 1.3.1. This cannot be changed as the button follows the style guide set by the
                Government Digital Services (GDS) design system. The Court cases and release dates service team will get
                in touch with GDS to provide feedback on this usability issue. The team are also exploring alternative
                designs using more accessible patterns.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The search button and menu button are obscured when 400 percent browser zoom is
                applied. The search button is completely lost off-screen and the menu button is partially obscured. You
                must scroll horizontally to access these elements.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">There are duplicate landmarks in the navigation. This may cause confusion and make it
                difficult to determine which landmark correctly describes the content of that region.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The ‘search for a prisoner’ research field is announced as a table when using a screen
                reader. This incorrect announcement could make it unclear how to interact with the element.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body"> When activating the menu in the navigation bar with the keyboard, there is an
                unexpected focus order. The focus shifts first to the search button, then proceeds into the menu items.
                This unexpected sequence could cause confusion to keyboard users.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">This statement was prepared on 13 November 2024. It was last reviewed on 13 November
                2024.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">This website was last tested on 15 August 2024.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The following approach was taken for the accessibility audit by a team of experienced
                accessibility consultants from User Vision.</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Automated testing using Accessibility Insights and WAVE.</li>
                <li>Manual accessibility evaluation to code level using browser code inspectors, an
                    approach that identifies issues that cannot be captured by automated tools.
                </li>
                <li>We viewed the application on a range of browsers:
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>Chrome, Firefox and Edge on desktop</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>We assessed pages using the following assistive technology:
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>NVDA (with Firefox and Chrome) screen reader for desktop.</li>
                        <li>JAWS (with Edge and Chrome) screen reader for desktop.</li>
                        <li>Dragon, the speech recognition software on desktop.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>We checked colour combinations using a colour contrast analyser to determine if there is enough
                    contrast in the visual presentation.
                </li>
            </ul>
