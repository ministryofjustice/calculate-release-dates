# Introduction to SDS Plus Release Point: Sentencing Bill 2020

The Sentencing Bill 2020 introduces a notable change in the release provisions for serious offenders through a framework known as SDS+ (SDS+ (Standard Determinate Sentence Plus). Central to SDS+ is the establishment of a two-thirds release point, signaling a departure from automatic halfway release practices for specific serious offences.

## Key Features of SDS+

### 1. Two-Thirds Release Point for 'Max-Life' Sexual Offences

A key aspect of SDS+ is the introduction of a two-thirds release point for individuals convicted of 'max-life' sexual offences. This release point is triggered when a Standard Determinate Sentence
(SDS) of 4 years or more is imposed.

### 2. Targeted Release Point Change for Violent Offenders
After 2022, SDS+ introduced a targeted release point change for violent offenders, particularly those receiving an SDS of 4 to 7 years for 4 Specified violent offences (Manslaughter, Soliciting Murder, Attempt or Conspiracy to Murder).
