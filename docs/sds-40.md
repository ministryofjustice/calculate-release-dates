# SDS40: Standard Determinate Sentences at 40% Release

## Background

Standard Determinate Sentences “40% release” (SDS40) is a policy introduced in 2024 that shifted the automatic release point for eligible standard determinate sentences from 50% to 40%. The change was introduced via amendments to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and applied both retrospectively and to new sentences from its commencement. SDS40 aimed to reduce pressure on the prison estate and was implemented in two tranches across September and October 2024.

The policy was part of a broader emergency response to prison overcrowding, announced by the Ministry of Justice in summer 2024. Thousands of individuals who had already served more than 40% of their custodial term were identified for early release under revised eligibility criteria. The approach sought to maintain public safety by applying robust exclusion rules, while enabling capacity relief in a controlled and legally supported way.

SDS40 remains in force and continues to shape the release framework for determinate sentences in England and Wales. Its impact is ongoing, with sentence calculations and release planning now aligned to the 40% rule for eligible cases.

## Tranching

SDS40 was introduced in two tranches to support a phased recalculation and release process:

- **Tranche 1 (10 September 2024)** – applied to prisoners serving SDS sentences where the longest sentence or aggregate in the sentence envelope was **less than 5 years**
- **Tranche 2 (22 October 2024)** – applied to all remaining eligible cases
- For **any sentence imposed on or after 10 September 2024**, SDS40 applies immediately (if eligible), and tranche rules do not apply.

To be included in Tranche 1, the following conditions had to be met:

- The person was **in custody on 10 September 2024**
- They had **at least one SDS sentence imposed before 10 September 2024**, which produced a **50% Conditional Release Date (CRD) on or after 10 September 2024**
- And either:
    - They had **no sentences or aggregates of 5 years or more** in their calculable sentence envelope or
    - They had **sentences or aggregates of 5 years or more**, but the **latest Sentence Licence Expiry Date (SLED)** of those longer sentences was **before 10 September 2024**

To be Tranche 2, a person must have longer SDS sentences or aggregates (5 years or more) with the latest SLED after 10 September 2024.

Generally, people **not in custody on 10 September 2024** were not considered for tranching or defaulting - though specific considerations apply.
Also, please refer to the SDS Operational Guidance for detailed examples and exceptions (e.g., transitional cases between tranches and aggregate sentences).


## Scope and Eligibility

SDS40 eligibility is assessed on a per-sentence basis. This means that when an individual is serving multiple sentences—whether concurrently or consecutively—each sentence is reviewed separately to determine whether it qualifies for release at 40%.

If one sentence is for an excluded offence, that sentence will retain its original release point (e.g. 50% or two-thirds), even if another sentence in the set qualifies under SDS40. The overall release date for the person will therefore depend on the interaction between the eligible and excluded sentences. This ensures that offenders serving time for more serious offences do not benefit from early release due to other, less serious eligible sentences running alongside them.

For instance, a person serving two standard determinate sentences concurrently—one for an SDS40-eligible offence and one for an excluded offence—will have the excluded sentence govern the release point if it requires a longer period in custody.

SDS40 applies to:

- Standard Determinate Sentences (SDS) for adults
- Detention in a Young Offender Institution (DYOI) for young adults (18–20)
- Section 250 Sentences (youth custodial sentences under the Sentencing Code) 
- Section 91 Sentences (which were replaced by Section 250 sentences)

These sentence types now carry an automatic release point at 40% of the custodial term for eligible offences. Offenders serve the remaining 60% on licence. Sentences outside this scope (e.g. extended determinate, life sentences) or governed by Parole Board release remain unaffected.

## Offence Exclusions

SDS40 only applies to sentences for eligible offences. Some offences are explicitly excluded and continue to require at least 50% custody. These include:

- All **sexual offences**, regardless of sentence length
- **Violent offences** where the custodial term is 4 years or more
- Specific **domestic abuse-related offences**, such as coercive control or non-fatal strangulation
- Offences related to **national security** or **terrorism**
- Any sentence subject to **two-thirds release** or **Parole Board approval**

A complete and up-to-date list of excluded offences is maintained (for MoJ users) as the [SDS Exclusion List on Manage Offences](https://manage-offences.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/schedules/sds-exclusion-lists).

### Update from 16 December 2024

As of 16 December 2024, six further offences have been excluded from SDS40:
- **Section 5** of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (breach of restraining order on conviction)
- **Section 5A** of the same Act (breach on acquittal)
- **Section 354** of the Sentencing Code (breach of a sexual harm prevention order)
- **Section 8** of the Stalking Protection Act 2019 (breaching a stalking protection order)
- **Section 33** of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 (disclosure of private sexual images with intent to cause distress, i.e. "revenge porn")
- **Murder**, where the person is serving a repatriated determinate sentence from a foreign jurisdiction

Inchoate offences (e.g. attempts, conspiracies) related to these are also excluded, except for murder, where a threshold of four years or more applies.
