**September 22nd 2023** - Ensure health/info endpoints are the same information as the Kotlin templates

As part of the work on the [service catalogue](https://hmpps-developer-portal.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/products) we are trying to ensure all services and applications present standard `/health` and `/info` endpoints. As the Kotlin template is provided with a standard set of information as part of Spring Boot, it made sense to make sure the Typrscript template was made to match. This ensures these endpoints can be processed programmatically without needing to know what format the information is being presented.

For more details ask on the `#hmpps-service-catalogue channel`.

**August 3rd 2023** - Add /info endpoint and expose product ids  

As part of the work on the [service catalogue](https://hmpps-developer-portal.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/products) we are giving all applications their own product id.
This change adds a new info endpoint to expose this id in a consistent place. 

For more details ask on the `#hmpps-service-catalogue channel`.

**June 9th 2023** - Do not retry POST requests by default

It's not safe to retry idempotent calls as this introduces the risk of creating multiple resources. This fix changes the default to not carry out any retries but allows switching on retrying if desired.

**April 13th 2023** - Caching fix

**February 3rd 2023** - Revert multi build docker image

Multibuild docker images ended up taking a very long time after the upgrade to node 18 (1hr+). Some work needs to be done to move to support multi host builds in our circle orb, in the meantime weâ€™ve removed this and are just building images solely for deployment.
